## Instructions for executing the file

1. First run the Linking_Loader_PASS1.cpp file using the cmd -> g++ Linking_Loader_PASS1.cpp -o p1.exe
2. Next run the cmd ./p1 in powershell windows.
3. Or run the cmd p1.exe in cmd anyone should work fine.
4. You can give your own objcode as input.

## Assumptions

1. Algorithm is followed from the text book.
2. Objcode should be same as given in the directory with ^ symbol else you need to modify the code internally.
